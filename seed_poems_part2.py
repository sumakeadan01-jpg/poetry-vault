And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading - treading - till it seemed
That Sense was breaking through -

And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum -
Kept beating - beating - till I thought
My mind was going numb -

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space - began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell,
And Being, but an Ear,
And I, and Silence, some strange Race,
Wrecked, solitary, here -

And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
And I dropped down, and down -
And hit a World, at every plunge,
And Finished knowing - then -'''

A Wooden way

Regardless grown,
A Quartz contentment, like a stone –

As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow –
First – Chill – then Stupor – then the letting go –'''

I guard My Master's Head -
'Tis better than the Eider Duck's

I see you with my eyes every day and scene

And I think all the earth is Layla when it expands'''

When we met at the slope of Ramah
And every gossiper and envier was absent from us
Our souls embraced before we saw each other

She said: Do you know this is forbidden?
I said to her: Passion is greater than asceticism
She said: Do you fear a watcher might see us?
I said to her: The eye of God watches over us
She said: What will you do if our families come?
I said to her: I would sacrifice you with my soul and body
